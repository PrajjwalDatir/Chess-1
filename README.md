# Chess
Chess developed in C using X11 for GUI. Includes single player and two player modes
Representation of board is done using integer two dimensional array. 
main.c contains all functions for validating moves and detecting checks/checkmate and draws.
I have coded the engine using an algorithm I thought of based on Minimax. It thinks 5 moves ahead from any given function and evaluates every possible legal move.
